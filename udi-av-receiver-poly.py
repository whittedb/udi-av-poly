Import the polyglot interface module. This is in pypy so you can just install it
normally. Replace pip with pip3 if you are using python3.

Virtualenv:
pip install polyinterface

Not Virutalenv:
pip install polyinterface --user

*I recommend you ALWAYS develop your NodeServers in virtualenv to maintain
cleanliness, however that isn't required. I do not condone installing pip
modules globally. Use the --user flag, not sudo.
